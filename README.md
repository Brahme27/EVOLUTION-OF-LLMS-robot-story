## Evolution of AI Robots

This repository explores the evolution of AI models from simple RNNs to powerful Transformers like GPT-4. 

# Evolution of LLMs:

1️⃣ **RNN** → Too forgetful!  
2️⃣ **LSTM** → Writes things down (better memory).  
3️⃣ **GRU** → Faster LSTM.  
4️⃣ **Bidirectional RNN** → Reads forward and backward.  
5️⃣ **Encoder-Decoder** → Learns to translate.  
6️⃣ **Attention** → Focuses on important words.  
7️⃣ **Transformers** → Processes all words at once (SUPER FAST & SMART).  

Transformers revolutionized AI, leading to models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude!
